# A UO Shard

This is the scripts for a Ultima Online shard running on RunUO.

The initial commit contains the default scripts that come with [the last version of RunUO](https://code.google.com/p/runuo/downloads/detail?name=RunUO2.3r987_Full.rar). All changes after that are my attempt at creating my own world. Let's see where this goes!

All binary files (including saves) and documentation have been gitignored but can be found at the above download link.
